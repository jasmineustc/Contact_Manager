The ngCloak directive is used to prevent the Angular html template
from being briefly displayed by the browser in its raw (uncompiled)
form while your application is loading. Use this directive to
avoid the undesirable flicker effect caused by the html template display.

See https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngCloak to read about ngCloak.

ngCloak works in cooperation with the following css rule.
